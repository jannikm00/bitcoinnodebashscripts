nodeinfo.sh shows: how many nodes youre connected to, the verification percentage and more.


startaddnode.sh can add a local node to your node so it downloads the blockchain faster.


startconnectnode.sh makes the node only connect to one singular node, most effectively a local node on the same network connected via ethernet. This is useful for not using any external bandwith.
